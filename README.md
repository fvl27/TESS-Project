This project is a summary of many codes made for my postdoctoral research in Astrophysics on transiting exoplanets.
Implementing many techniques such as a lot of data extraction and downloading. In this programme we use CVS tables from the Exoplanet data base and photometric data from the TESS satellite observatory. We filtered the important information we needed in exoplanets tables. We select in detail the photometric data with specific carefully in duplicated lightcurves, and checking the cadence needed.
After the data were correctly cured, we started with the photometric analysis using the Box-Least-Square algorithm for looking for periodic signals in two different stages. We also performed a teorical modeling of light curves to compare

## Motivation:


## Features
The research was performed in two stages, first we loo

Footnote: the hot dust component may or may not be present in your type 2 
nuclei, do not get disappointed if NIRDust finds nothing.


## Requeriments

You will need Python 3.8 or higher to run NIRDust.

## Installation

You can install the least stable version of NIRDust from pip:


``` python
$ pip install nirdust
```

Or, for the develovepment instalation clone this repository and then inside the local directory execute

``` python
$ pip install -e .
```
